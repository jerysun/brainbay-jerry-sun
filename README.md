# Brainbay Opdracht

A .NET 8 solution consists of two apps using DDD. MSSQLLocalDB is adopted because it's automatically installed with VS, hence each .NET developer has an access.

## Two Apps:

- CharactersCrawler, a console app, responsible for data acquisition. This must be run first to create database and populate the data.
- Characters.API, an entry of a web app, responsible for data access from and to database.

Please feel free to ask me if you have any questions or anything unclear.
